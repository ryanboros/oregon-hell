# OregonHell

A minimal Oregon Trail clone, based on the code example from GameDev Academy, https://gamedevacademy.org/js13kgames-tutorial/

Once the game is started, the caravan will move along automatically, traversing distances, consuming resources, and being affectly by random event similar to the original game. There will be random shops and bandit attacks that the user can decide how to navigate diminishing resources. Will you make it to Oregon or die along the way? Welcome to Oregon Hell.
